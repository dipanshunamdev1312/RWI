** Collection Interface ** 

* If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then we should go for Collection.

* In general collection interface is considered as root interface of Collection Framework.

* Collection Interface defines the most common methods which are applicable for any collection object.


**Important methods of Collection Interface**

boolean add(Object o)
boolean addAll(Collection c)
boolean remove(Object o)
boolean removeAll(Collection c)
boolean reatainAll(Collection c)
void clear()
boolean contains(Object o)
boolean containsAll(Collection c)
boolean isEmpty()
int size()
object[] toArray()
Iterator iterator()


Note: Collection interface doesn't contains any method to retrieve objects there is no concrete class which implements collection class directly.
