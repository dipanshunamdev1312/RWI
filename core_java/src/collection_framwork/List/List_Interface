List Interface 

* it is the child interface of collection.
* if we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity where duplicates are allowed and insertion order must be preserved then we should go for List.
* we can differentiate duplicates by using index.
* we can preserve insertion order by using index , hence index play very important role in list interface.

** List interface specific methods ** 

	void add (int index , Object o)
	boolean addAll(int index, Collection c)
	object remove(int index)
	object get(int index)
	object set(int index , Object new)
	int indexOf(Object o)
	int lastIndexOf(Object o)
	ListIterator listItrator();
